        <h2>Deep Learning and PIML Integration into Nextgen</h2>
        <p>
            I am integrating and testing deep learning (DL) and physics-informed deep learning (PIML) streamflow models and data assimilation into NOAAâ€™s Next Generation Water Modeling Engine and Framework Prototype (Nextgen: <a href="https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen">github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen</a>), set to replace the U.S. National Water Model (NWM) by 2024. I am focusing on DL-assisted data assimilation and ensemble forecasting capabilities, proven in both research and operational settings. Supported by the open-source NeuralHydrology (NH) codebase, which I began integrating with Nextgen in 2020 through a collaboration between the University of Alabama and the National Water Center, this project will make all existing and emerging DL capabilities in NH accessible to Nextgen. I am coordinating this work with other CIROH forecasting and modeling projects.

        <h2>Hydrologic laws from Neural Networks</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently working on deriving hydrologic laws from the equations of deep learning, focusing specifically on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This project aims to uncover fundamental hydrologic principles by analyzing the trained models and their learned representations. By leveraging the capabilities of RNNs and CNNs, I hope to gain insights into the complex dynamics of hydrologic systems. This research has the potential to bridge the gap between machine learning models and traditional hydrologic theory, leading to more accurate and interpretable predictions.
